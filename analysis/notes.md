**TODO - Figures:**
- number of on-target fixations till identifications, split by category & trial type (with and without bad-action trials) - histogram
- number of on-target visits till identifications - histogram (with and without bad-action trials; split by category and overall)
- number of all fixations till first identification - line plot (with and without bad-action trials; split by category and search-array type)
- % identified after bottom-strip visits (include non-identified) - cumulative histogram for -4, -3, ... fixations back from identification
- exploration/exploitation - fixation duration and saccade sizes over trial time - line plot (also by category and search-array type)
